## 🧾 Abstract

With the rise of remote work, securing user access to enterprise systems has become more critical than ever. While VPNs have long been the standard, Zero Trust introduces a new approach based on identity, context, and continuous validation. This paper compares both models to help researchers and professionals understand their strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases.
